# Icon Files

This extension requires icon files in PNG format with the following sizes:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using any image editor. The icons should represent the extension's purpose of validating email addresses.

Suggested icon design:
- An envelope (📧) with a checkmark
- An @ symbol with a shield
- A merge icon with an email indicator

## Quick Setup

If you want to test the extension without custom icons, you can create simple placeholder icons using any online icon generator or image editor.

For development purposes, you can also temporarily remove the `icons` section from `manifest.json` if you don't have icon files ready yet.
